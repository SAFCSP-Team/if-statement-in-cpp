# If Statement in C++

### Objective

In this project, our main goal is to understand how if-statement works in C++.

### Problem

Develop a program that takes an integer input from the user, and if the input type is not valid, display `invalid input type`.

> hint: use if statement with `cin.good()`. 

### Implementation
- Write your code in the main function.
  
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    /* Your code here*/
    return 0;
}

```
